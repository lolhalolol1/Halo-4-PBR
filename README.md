Credit to the Oomer and Chiefster whos shaders I used as reference for how to work with Halo 4's functions, theChunkierBean for testing, and theHostileNegotiator and Amit for important help and feedback.

To install, simply download and drag-n-drop the "shaders" folder into your H4EK's "tags" folder.
