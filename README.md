Credit to the Oomer and Chiefster whos shaders I used as reference for how to work with Halo 4's functions, theChunkierBean for testing, and theHostileNegotiator and Amit for important help and feedback.

To install, simply download and drag-n-drop the "shaders" folder into your H4EK's "tags" folder.

Input maps are as follows:

Metalness-Roughness workflow:

  -Albedo map
  -ORM map (R = Ambient Occlusion, G = Roughness, B = Metallness, A = Height)
  -Normal map
  -Detail normal map

Spec-Gloss workflow:

  -Albedo Map
  -Specular Map (RGB = f0, A = glossiness)
  -Occlusion Map (RGB = Ambient Occlusion, A = height)
  -Normal map
  -Detail normal map
  
Also optionally...
  -Emissive map


Next focuses are terrain blending and (maybe) terrain tesselation.
